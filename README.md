# EVCC + Home Assistant + Battery (Custom Integration)

This repository contains an advanced integration guide for using EVCC with Home Assistant and a battery system that supports active control (e.g., Sonnen, Victron, BYD...). The approach is based on a `custom` meter definition and is fully adaptable to any battery exposing control endpoints over HTTP or local API.
